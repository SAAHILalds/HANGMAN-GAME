# HANGMAN-GAME
Hangman is a word-guessing game where the user has to use his/her wits to figure out the word
the project which we have worked is called hangman game so it is a word guessing game where the user gets to find the given word by guessing each alphabet one by one so the user gets 7 chances 7 wrong chances so every word even if he starts guessing each alphabet one by one if the alphabet is present in the word given by the game then the word with the alphabet will be displayed in the position where it is present and suppose in  case of alphabet is not present then a chance would be taken out from the user so the user gets 7 chances and in case of 7 wrong guesses the user loses and in case of user guesses the word then he wins the game
and talking about the timeline the initial stage of the project was we just took a word and tried to just find out if the alphabet was present or not in the latest version of the code we tried to create an hang and picture as in which I played in software where image depiction where each time a user guides and drawing alphabet then a man is being hand with soap one by one
and the next version what we did was instead of having a single word we tried to create an array of words which is random in nature so each time a player plays  he gets a different word this way the game becomes fun
